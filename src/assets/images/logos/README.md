This directory holds the brand images for the Foodify application.

During the original extraction of the repository the `src/assets/images/logos` folder was missing and therefore the application referenced logo files that weren't present.  To resolve this issue we have created this folder and placed a new Foodify logo in `foodify-logo.png`.  The logo was generated to provide a simple, modern representation of the Foodify brand and can be replaced with your own artwork if desired.

```
src/assets/images/logos/foodify-logo.png
```

If you wish to update the logo, replace the `foodify-logo.png` file with your own image.  Ensure that any other references (for example in `public/images`) are also updated accordingly.
